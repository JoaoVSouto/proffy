## ðŸ’» Overview

**Proffy** is a platform which facilitates the connection between students and teachers.

In there you have the possibilities to register yourself as a **teacher**, giving your phone number, the subject to be taught and your available schedule or you can simply access as a **student** and get to connect to a teacher in your desired subject.

It was develop during the **NLW - Next Level Week #2** offered by [Rocketseat](https://rocketseat.com.br/) :rocket:.
